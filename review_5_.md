i. Interest of contents
The topic of cats is very interesting, however, barring the title and header, there is no further mention of cats.

Where are the cats?

On the other hand, the individual pages are interesting but it would be nice if the theme was more consistent.

ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Visually, the website is fantastic. The website is clean and features an overall consisent design between different pages. The strucutre of the index page is intuitive and easy to navigate.

One issue we found was that on Diabetic Retinopathy the navbar displays incorrectly, so this instance is inconsistent.

Another issue is two home buttons which causes redundancy and makes the website more unintuitive.

Again, the contents of the page could be more consistent with the topic of cats and Heatlthcare, Environment and Diabetic Retinoapthy being unlinked.

That being said, otherwise, the website is well designed.

iii. Quality of written presentation
The quality of written presentiation is good overall. The pages are easy to read and the volume is not overwhelming because of good separation of pages.

iv. Validity of HTML
All the HTML is valid and generates as expected.

v. Balanced contribution of members
More author info would be valuable in the future.

Based on commits and the division of the different pages amongst members, the contribution looks fairly even.
