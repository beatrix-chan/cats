                    <h2>Medical Diagnostics</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most transformative applications of computing
                        in healthcare. AI systems can process and analyze vast amounts of medical data such as X-rays,
                        MRI scans, and lab reports—faster and often more accurately than human doctors. Machine learning
                        algorithms detect early signs of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart conditions,
                        helping clinicians make quicker and more reliable diagnoses.</p>

                    <p>For example, research by Al-Waeli and Abdul Hameed (2024) found that AI tools improved
                        diagnostic precision and reduced medical errors by analyzing complex imaging data effectively
                        (Wasit Journal for Pure Sciences). Similarly, Hirosawa and Shimizu (2025) reported that
                        AI-powered systems improve workflow efficiency and personalize treatment recommendations by
                        combining different patient data sources (Computers, Materials & Continua).</p>

                    <h2>Telemedicine</h2>
                    <p>Telemedicine uses computing and communication technologies to deliver healthcare remotely.
                        Through video consultations, mobile apps, and digital monitoring devices, patients can connect
                        with doctors regardless of physical distance. This has proven vital for people in rural and
                        underserved regions, who may lack access to hospitals or specialists.</p>

                    <p>A 2024 study published in Frontiers in Healthcare Technology found that telemedicine
                        significantly improved healthcare accessibility and reduced travel costs for rural patients
                        (Frontiers in Healthcare Technology). Likewise, a PubMed study (2024) showed that telemedicine
                        programs in rural China enhanced healthcare satisfaction and access, allowing doctors to monitor
                        chronic conditions more effectively (PubMed Article). Computing makes these systems possible
                        through reliable internet platforms, secure data storage, and real-time communication
                        technologies.</p>

                <section class="mb-5">
                    <h2>Assistive Technologies</h2>
                    <p>Computing also supports patients with disabilities and chronic illnesses through assistive
                        technologies. Tools such as voice-controlled devices, AI-driven prosthetics, smart wheelchairs,
                        and wearable sensors enable individuals to live more independently. These technologies are
                        particularly important for monitoring vital signs and alerting caregivers in emergencies.</p>

                    <p>Philips (2021) discussed how healthcare digitalization, supported by computing, contributes to
                        better patient experiences and sustainability by reducing unnecessary hospital visits and
                        improving energy efficiency (Philips Blog). Assistive computing enhances the quality of life for
                        patients while making healthcare more inclusive and responsive to diverse needs.</p>
